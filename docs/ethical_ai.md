# MindMate AI - Ethical AI Guidelines

## AI Models Used

### OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Purpose**: Journal entry summarization and gentle reflection suggestions
- **Training Data**: Pre-trained on diverse internet text (as of 2021)
- **Bias Considerations**: May reflect societal biases present in training data
- **Usage**: Server-side processing only, no data retention by OpenAI

### Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis
- **Model**: cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
- **Purpose**: Sentiment scoring of journal entries
- **Limitations**: Trained on social media data, may not generalize to personal journals
- **Fallback**: Rule-based sentiment analysis when API unavailable

## Prompt Engineering

### Summarization Prompts
- **Tone**: Gentle, supportive, non-judgmental
- **Length**: Brief summaries (1-2 sentences)
- **Focus**: Reflection and encouragement, not diagnosis
- **Example**: "You are a gentle, supportive AI assistant that helps users reflect on their journal entries..."

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Approach**: Three-class classification (positive, neutral, negative)
- **Scoring**: 0-1 scale for mood tracking visualization
- **Fallback**: Keyword-based analysis when AI services fail

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

### AI Service Failures
- **OpenAI API Down**: Returns "Summary unavailable" with generic suggestions
- **Hugging Face API Down**: Falls back to rule-based sentiment analysis
- **Rate Limiting**: Graceful degradation, no user-facing errors
- **Invalid Responses**: Default neutral sentiment and generic summary

### Data Privacy
- **No Data Retention**: AI services don't store user journal entries
- **Server-Side Processing**: API keys never exposed to client
- **Local Storage**: Only user ID stored, no sensitive data
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security prevents data leakage

## Disclaimers & Limitations

### Medical Disclaimer
- **Not Medical Advice**: AI insights are for personal reflection only
- **Professional Help**: Users encouraged to seek professional mental health support
- **Crisis Situations**: App not designed for mental health emergencies
- **Self-Harm**: No detection or intervention for self-harm content

### AI Limitations
- **Accuracy**: AI can be wrong, especially with nuanced emotional content
- **Bias**: Models may reflect training data biases
- **Context**: AI lacks full context of user's life and circumstances
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: May not account for cultural differences in expression

## User Rights & Controls

### Data Ownership
- **User Data**: All journal entries belong to the user
- **Export**: Users can export their data (future feature)
- **Deletion**: Users can delete their account and all associated data
- **Privacy**: No sharing of personal data with third parties

### Opt-Out Options
- **AI Analysis**: Users can disable AI processing (future feature)
- **Data Collection**: Minimal data collection, only essential for functionality
- **Marketing**: No marketing communications or data selling
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of AI usage and limitations

## Responsible AI Principles

### Fairness
- **Non-Discrimination**: AI responses don't discriminate based on protected characteristics
- **Inclusive Design**: App designed for diverse users and use cases
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular review of AI responses for bias

### Transparency
- **Clear Labeling**: AI-generated content clearly marked
- **Open Source**: Core components available for inspection
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of AI usage

### Accountability
- **Error Reporting**: Users can report AI errors or inappropriate responses
- **Regular Review**: Periodic review of AI performance and user feedback
- **Continuous Improvement**: Updates based on user feedback and ethical considerations

## Contact & Reporting

### Issues & Concerns
- **Technical Issues**: Report bugs through GitHub issues
- **AI Concerns**: Report inappropriate AI responses
- **Privacy Questions**: Contact through app support channels
- **Ethical Concerns**: Direct contact for serious ethical issues

### Regular Review
- **Quarterly Assessment**: Review AI performance and user feedback
- **Annual Audit**: Comprehensive review of ethical AI practices
- **Community Input**: User feedback incorporated into improvements
- **Industry Standards**: Alignment with evolving AI ethics standards
