# MindMate AI - Development Log

## What We Tried

### Architecture Decisions
- [x] Next.js 14 App Router for modern React patterns
- [x] Supabase for backend-as-a-service (auth + database)
- [x] Server-side AI processing for security
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- [x] Graceful AI failure handling with fallbacks

### AI Integration
- [x] OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for summarization
- [x] Hugging Face Inference API for sentiment analysis
- [x] Rule-based sentiment fallback when APIs fail
- [x] Prompt engineering for gentle, supportive responses

### UI/UX Choices
- [x] shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
- [x] Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- [x] Recharts for mood visualization
- [x] Dark mode toggle
- [x] Responsive 3-panel layout
- [x] Toast notifications for user feedback

### Data Model
- [x] Simple 3-table schema (profiles, entries, sentiments)
- [x] UUID primary keys
- [x] Proper foreign key relationships
- [x] Timestamp tracking for mood trends

## What We Learned

### Technical Insights
- **Supabase RLS**: Essential for multi-tenant data security
- **AI Rate Limits**: Need graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specific prompts crucial for consistent AI behavior
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling prevents app crashes

### User Experience
- **Simplicity Wins**: Clean interface more important than feature richness
- **Feedback Matters**: Toast notifications improve perceived performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: App works even when AI services fail
- **Privacy First**: Users trust apps that clearly protect their data

### Development Process
- **TypeScript**: Catches errors early, improves developer experience
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui accelerates UI development
- **Environment Variables**: Critical for different deployment environments
- **Database Migrations**: Version control for schema changes

### Challenges Overcome
- **Authentication Flow**: Client-side auth state management complexity
- **AI Service Reliability**: Building robust fallbacks for external APIs
- **Data Visualization**: Making mood data meaningful and actionable
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring mobile-first experience

### Performance Considerations
- **Server-Side AI**: Prevents API key exposure, better for rate limiting
- **Database Indexing**: Essential for query performance with user data
- **Component Optimization**: Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- **Bundle Size**: Careful dependency selection for Vercel deployment

### Security Measures
- **Environment Variables**: Never expose secrets in client code
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level access control
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizing user content before AI processing
- **Error Logging**: Server-side logging without exposing sensitive data
