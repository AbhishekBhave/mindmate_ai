# Dashboard Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Summary

Fixed three blocking problems on the dashboard:
1. âœ… Mood graph now has real data inputs
2. âœ… Progress Insights show computed server metrics
3. âœ… New journal entries save and produce AI guidance

## Files Changed

### Core Server Infrastructure
1. **`server/supabase/server-client.ts`** (NEW - already created)
   - Server Supabase client helper
   - Properly reads/writes cookies for auth
   - Never exposes service role to browser

2. **`lib/dashboard-data.ts`** (MODIFIED - rewritten)
   - Fetches entries and sentiments separately
   - Stitches data in memory by entry_id
   - Computes mood graph by bucketing entries by day
   - Calculates Progress Insights on server
   - Includes `ai_feedback` in sentiment query
   - Structured error logging

### API Routes
3. **`app/api/entries/route.ts`** (MAJOR REWRITE)
   - Gets `userId` from authenticated session (not request body)
   - Creates entry with analysis
   - Stores `ai_feedback` in sentiments table
   - Reads back complete entry with sentiment
   - Structured error logging

4. **`app/api/health/dashboard/route.ts`** (ALREADY UPDATED)
   - Verifies session
   - Returns entry count and sample entry ID

### Dashboard Components
5. **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for live updates

6. **`app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Removed `userId` from POST request body (server gets from session)
   - Handles new API response format
   - Updates UI immediately after submission

### Database
7. **`supabase/policies.sql`** (ALREADY CREATED)
   - RLS policies for entries, sentiments, profiles

8. **`docs/schema-add-ai-feedback.sql`** (EXISTS)
   - Migration to add `ai_feedback` column to sentiments table

## Database Setup Required

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add ai_feedback column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE sentiments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ai_feedback TEXT;
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd /Users/abhishekbhave/mindmate_ai
npm run dev
```

### 2. Sign In
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sign-in`
- Sign in with your credentials

### 3. Submit a Positive Entry
In the dashboard textarea, enter:
```
I'm feeling great today! Just got promoted at work and I couldn't be happier. This is a huge achievement for me.
```

Click "Save & Analyze Entry"

Expected:
- Toast: "Entry saved successfully! ðŸŽ‰"
- Entry appears in Recent Entries list
- Mood graph shows a new positive point
- Progress Insights update
- AI Guidance shows personalized reflection

### 4. Submit a Negative Entry
In the dashboard textarea, enter:
```
I'm really struggling with stress lately. Work has been overwhelming and I feel exhausted all the time. I don't know how to cope.
```

Click "Save & Analyze Entry"

Expected:
- Toast: "Entry saved successfully! ðŸŽ‰"
- Entry appears in Recent Entries list with negative sentiment badge
- Mood graph shows a new negative point
- Progress Insights update with new count
- AI Guidance shows empathetic reflection

### 5. Verify Mood Graph
- Should show data points for each day with entries
- Positive entries show high scores (green)
- Negative entries show low scores (red)
- Neutral entries show medium scores (amber)

### 6. Verify Progress Insights
- **Entries This Week**: Shows actual count from last 7 days
- **Day Streak**: Calculated from consecutive days with entries
- **Mood Distribution**: Pie chart with real positive/neutral/negative counts from last 14 days
- **Average Mood Score**: Computed from last week's sentiment scores

### 7. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/dashboard
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "userId": "uuid",
  "count": 2,
  "sampleEntryId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-..."
}
```

## Server Console Logs to Check

When submitting entries, you should see:
```
[API/ENTRIES] Starting AI analysis for entry: <uuid>
[API/ENTRIES] AI analysis complete: { label: 'positive', score: 0.8, confidence: 0.85 }
```

When loading dashboard:
```
[DASHBOARD] Fetching data for user: <uuid>
[DASHBOARD] Found entries: 2
[DASHBOARD] Processed entries with sentiments: 2
ðŸ“Š [DASHBOARD] Mood graph points: 1
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Typecheck passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` âœ…
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build` âœ…
- [ ] Health endpoint returns data
- [ ] Positive entry saves and displays AI guidance
- [ ] Negative entry saves and displays AI guidance
- [ ] Mood graph renders with real data
- [ ] Progress Insights show real counts
- [ ] Recent Entries list updates immediately
- [ ] No empty `{}` errors in console
- [ ] No "Summary unavailable" messages (unless OpenAI fails)

## Technical Details

### Entry Submission Flow
1. User submits entry via `/api/entries` POST
2. Server gets `userId` from authenticated session
3. Entry inserted into `entries` table
4. AI analysis runs (OpenAI + sentiment analysis)
5. Sentiment saved to `sentiments` table with `ai_feedback`
6. Complete entry with sentiment read back
7. Response includes full entry data
8. Dashboard calls `router.refresh()` to get fresh data

### Data Fetching Flow
1. Server component calls `getDashboardData()`
2. Gets authenticated session
3. Queries entries for last 30 days: `.eq('user_id', userId)`
4. Queries sentiments: `.in('entry_id', entryIds)`
5. Stitches in memory by entry_id
6. Computes mood graph (buckets by day, averages scores)
7. Computes Progress Insights
8. Returns typed `DashboardData`

### Mood Graph Computation
- Buckets entries by calendar day (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Averages sentiment scores per day
- Labels: positive (â‰¥0.6), negative (â‰¤0.4), neutral (otherwise)
- Clamps scores to [0, 1] range
- Sorts ascending by date

### Progress Insights Computation
- **Weekly Entries**: Last 7 days with sentiment
- **Average Mood**: Average of weekly sentiment scores
- **Mood Distribution**: Counts from last 14 days (positive/neutral/negative)
- **Streak**: Consecutive days with at least one entry

## Known Limitations

1. AI analysis timeout is not configurable (defaults to OpenAI timeouts)
2. Fallback sentiment uses rule-based analysis
3. No pagination for entries (limited to 100 most recent)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
git restore app/api/entries/route.ts
git restore lib/dashboard-data.ts
git restore app/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx
```

## Success Metrics

After completing test steps:
- 2+ entries saved successfully
- Mood graph shows 2 distinct points
- Progress Insights show non-zero counts
- AI Guidance shows personalized messages
- No console errors
- Health endpoint returns `{ ok: true, count: 2 }`

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add loading states for AI analysis
2. Add optimistic UI updates
3. Add entry pagination
4. Add entry search/filter
5. Cache API responses
6. Add retry logic for failed AI calls
