# Final Fixes Applied - Sentiment Column Error

## Problem Identified

The dashboard was failing with error:
```
column sentiments.created_at does not exist
```

This was because:
1. The sentiments table doesn't have a `created_at` column
2. Our queries were trying to select it
3. This caused all sentiment fetching to fail

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed `created_at` from Sentiments Queries

**File:** `lib/dashboard-data.ts`
- Changed: `.select('id, entry_id, score, label, confidence, summary, ai_feedback, emotions, created_at')`
- To: `.select('id, entry_id, score, label, confidence, summary, ai_feedback, emotions')`
- Updated stitching to use entry's `created_at` instead

**File:** `app/api/entries/route.ts`
- Same fix in the read-back query

### 2. Switched from `getSession()` to `getUser()` for Security

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/auth.ts`
- `lib/dashboard-data.ts`
- `app/api/entries/route.ts`
- `app/api/health/dashboard/route.ts`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Why:** The warning message said using `getSession()` is insecure because it comes from storage (cookies). Using `getUser()` authenticates the data by contacting the Supabase Auth server.

## Files Changed

1. âœ… `lib/dashboard-data.ts` - Removed `created_at` from sentiment query
2. âœ… `app/api/entries/route.ts` - Removed `created_at` from sentiment query, changed to `getUser()`
3. âœ… `app/api/health/dashboard/route.ts` - Changed to `getUser()`
4. âœ… `lib/auth.ts` - Changed to `getUser()` and return format
5. âœ… `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use new `requireAuth()` return format

## Verification

```bash
# Typecheck
npx tsc --noEmit
# âœ… Passes

# Build  
npm run build
# âœ… Successful
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see in the dev server:
- âœ… No "column sentiments.created_at does not exist" errors
- âœ… `[DASHBOARD] Processed entries with sentiments: N` where N > 0
- âœ… `ðŸ“Š [DASHBOARD] Mood graph points: N` where N > 0
- âœ… No authentication security warnings

## Testing

1. Restart dev server (or wait for hot reload)
2. Visit dashboard
3. Check console - should see:
   ```
   [DASHBOARD] Found entries: 25
   [DASHBOARD] Processed entries with sentiments: 25
   ðŸ“Š [DASHBOARD] Mood graph points: X
   ```
4. Mood graph should now have data
5. Progress Insights should show real counts
6. Recent Entries should show with sentiment badges

## Summary

The root issue was querying a non-existent database column. By removing `created_at` from sentiment queries and switching to the more secure `getUser()` method, the dashboard should now load correctly with full sentiment data.
